            "Redesigned the corporate website for Tim Corporation from the ground up to boost engagement among young to middle-aged users and strengthen brand credibility. I led the project independently, beginning with audience research that guided design choices around color, layout, and typography. I used Photoshop to create custom site assets and JavaScript to implement interactive elements like a sticky navigation bar. Performance was a priority—I optimized all media and distributed the site via a CDN for faster load times. Following launch, the client reported a noticeable uptick in user engagement within the first few months, and they continue to use the design today.",

            "Designed a mobile-first UX/UI prototype for Bible Explosion Org, aimed at streamlining how users—ranging from teens to older adults—join and engage with weekly virtual Bible meetings. The design intentionally avoids heavy religious symbolism, focusing instead on clean layouts, strong visual storytelling, and inclusive accessibility. I balanced the feature sets across mobile and desktop views to prevent bloat and ensure a focused experience on both platforms. The prototype was tested with stakeholders and future developers, earning positive feedback particularly for its intuitive UI and cohesive aesthetic. I'm especially proud of how the visual style communicates the simplicity and utility of the app: a space to join and connect, not to overwhelm.",

            "Designed the first-ever landing page for Yassuh International to distill key elements from the company’s business plan into a sleek, professional interface. Aimed at potential investors and clients, the design strikes a careful balance between public-facing appeal and brand discretion, aligning with the company's goal of avoiding oversharing in a competitive space. I worked from a brand guide but added custom assets where needed—designing parts of the hero section in Photoshop and Illustrator. To accommodate shifting feedback around the color palette, I implemented Figma variables for dynamic theming across the design. I also leveraged component libraries to accelerate iteration and maintain consistency. Throughout the project, I helped guide content structure and UX strategy, using research and experience to fill in gaps where the client was uncertain. This prototype directly led into the site's development phase.",

            "Developed a multilingual landing site for Yassuh International, targeting LATAM audiences and built entirely solo using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The goal was to bring the company’s brand to life digitally based on my own UX prototype, while introducing language support through next-intl for global accessibility. I handled full integration of design-to-dev assets, including responsive layouts, scroll-based animations, and component styling with Tailwind CSS. Faced with limitations on next-intl’s free tier, I proactively explored fallbacks using native i18n support to future-proof the architecture. Image optimization, semantic HTML, and a Vercel-based deployment strategy helped ensure strong performance and SEO readiness. While the project was eventually shelved during internal restructuring, it was positively received by leadership and served as a strong internal benchmark for what their digital presence could be.",

Designed from the ground up, the app featured two user dashboards: one for agronomists to assign and monitor fieldwork, and another for farmers to manage tasks in sync with their assigned agronomist. I led the design process end-to-end—starting with wireframes and stakeholder sessions, then building an interactive prototype in Figma that mimicked real-world functionality. The most demanding part of the project was refining the prototype to communicate complex flows to stakeholders who needed a near-production-level experience before they could visualize the concept. Despite the project being shelved due to a strategic pivot, the feedback on the design was highly positive. I'm especially proud of the intuitive task assignment flow and the flexible design system I implemented, which allowed for rapid, scalable iterations during the build.",

With only 72 hours before launch, I was brought in to design, develop, and deploy the site from the ground up—without a pre-existing mockup. Working directly with stakeholders under tight time pressure, I helped define essential content and trimmed out non-critical pieces. I designed in-code as I built, ensuring the structure, UX, and responsiveness were dialed in for a polished experience. The layout effectively communicated the company’s vision, services, and leadership team while remaining performant and accessible. Despite the intense timeline, the site was completed and launched on schedule. Stakeholders were ecstatic with the results, particularly the smooth user experience and professional presentation achieved in such a short turnaround.",

Built from scratch, the platform combines an elegant, responsive design with a robust backend, serving both general visitors and core community members. Future iterations will introduce features like a blog, donation system via Stripe, and a resource library — all built in an agile, iterative process. I handled the full development lifecycle: from database schema and authentication logic to UI/UX design and deployment. The platform features dynamic user and admin dashboards, media integration, and tailored navigation flows. I implemented multiple error handling states and built a scalable architecture to support future growth. The design of the landing page is one of my proudest UI accomplishments, matching the original vision I had for a clean, non-denominational, welcoming faith-based platform. Although not publicly launched yet, internal testing with stakeholders has returned overwhelmingly positive feedback, affirming both the user experience and technical reliability.",

I focused on a colorful but minimal design, subtly showcasing my UI/UX capabilities while maintaining a strong front-end development emphasis. The site featured a categorized project showcase (web & UX/UI), a concise personal bio, and a breakdown of my tech stack. I even included a profile image to make the experience more personable and relatable. While working solo on this project, I faced some early hurdles around state management that limited a few design ideas I initially wanted to implement. However, the process turned out to be a great learning experience—I refined my React skills significantly, especially around the useEffect hook and component reuse. The feedback I received from friends and family was encouraging and constructive. It affirmed the design's approachability while helping me recognize areas where I could push further in future versions. I'm most proud that I shipped something functional and visually thoughtful while deepening my technical skills—laying a strong foundation for my next iteration.",

Although not client-commissioned, it was treated as a realistic scenario to test my ability to create intuitive, conversion-friendly UI from scratch. My approach involved studying other successful competitors in the space to understand patterns in user behavior, layout priorities, and content structure. I focused heavily on visual storytelling, creating mockups that used large imagery, clean type, and service-focused sections to mirror a premium in-person experience. The goal was to ensure that visitors could quickly grasp the brand’s value and services. Because this was a concept project, I had full creative freedom. I prioritized accessibility, whitespace, and responsiveness in the layout, and imagined how animations and interactivity could enhance user experience without being distracting. This prototype now serves as a strong portfolio piece for showcasing my design process, presentation clarity, and ability to rethink an outdated web presence with modern design principles.",

My primary motivation for this project was to deepen my understanding and mastery of advanced React hooks, including the Context Hook, Reducer Hook, and Custom Hooks. One of the biggest challenges was debugging issues caused by sections not being properly wrapped in the ContextProvider. It took some time to diagnose the problem, but the experience gave me valuable insights into React’s context system and how to avoid similar pitfalls in the future. The portfolio serves as a living showcase of my skills and projects. A feature I’m particularly proud of is the implementation of a theme toggle, which added a genuine and engaging aura to the site. This was my first time integrating theming at this level, and it was both fun and rewarding.",
